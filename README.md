# Responsive Disneyplus landing page - responsive weather web application
This is a landing page for Disneys new streaming platform Disneyplus. I enjoyed creating it because Marvel is my favorite studio and as you know Disney/Mickey owns it now.

## General info
The purpose of the project was to practise building a real landing page that is fully responsive for tablets and mobile devices.    

## Setup
You can see the landing page from here [Disney+](https://oybekjp.github.io/disney-plus/).

## Features
List of features 
* Disney+ landing page is full responsive for different screen sizes such as tablets and mobile phones. 
* My favorite feature: Play respective intro music for Pixar, Marvel, and Disney on mouse over using JQuery. Stop musicon mouseout. Make sure to allow autoplay media on your browser. 
* Displays beautiful .gif images on hover for respective studios along with
